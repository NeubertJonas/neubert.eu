I’m Jonas Neubert, a PhD fellow at the Section for Health Services Research, University of Copenhagen. As part of the DataSpace project, I investigate patient mobility within the European Union through the lens of cross-border ePrescriptions. The primary focus is on patients’ lived experiences—examining to what extent health-data infrastructures can lead to meaning changes in patient care.\nMy previous research at Maastricht University highlighted how romantic couples navigate shared experiences of—psychedelic-induced—altered states of consciousness. The publication will be available soon. In the meantime, you can find the pre-print here.\nGet in touch via email (jonas at neubert dot eu) or visit my ORCID profile.\n\n\nPhD Fellow\nDataSpace\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Denmark | 05/2024 – 04/2027\n\n\n\nMSc in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience\nDrug Development and Neurohealth\n(research master specialisation)\nMaastricht University, Netherlands | 09/2021 – 08/2023\nBA in Liberal Arts and Sciences\nSocial Sciences / Humanites Concentration\nMaastricht University | 09/2016 – 08/2021\n\n\n\nMember of the Participatory Advisory Council\nMIND Foundation | 2021 – 2022\nFounder and Coordinator of uniMIND Maastricht\nMIND Foundation, Berlin, Germany | 2020 – 2022\nScientific Research Assistant\nInstitute of Sociology at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology, Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg | 2020 – 2023"

    "text": "Workshop Description\n\n\n\n\n\nGo is more than just a game. It is a journey of discovery, a way of living, and a source of wisdom. Go is one of the oldest and most sophisticated board games in the world, with a rich history of over 4,000 years. It has been played by thinkers, leaders, artists, and innovators across time and space. Go challenges you to create territory, capture stones, and balance attack and defense on a 19x19 grid. But it also teaches you essential skills such as patience, discipline, open-mindedness, creativity, and intuition. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of Go while exploring the philosophy behind Go. You will see how Go can be a metaphor for life, where each move is a decision that affects your future. You will also experience how Go can be a dialogue of hands, where you communicate with your opponent through your stones. Whether you are new to Go or already familiar with it, this workshop will inspire you to Go with the flow and find joy in playing this ancient board game.\nThanks for joining the workshop at UCM’s 20th Anniversary Knowledge Festival. Below, I have collected a few useful resources to get you started if you wish to explore this fascinating game afterwards. You may also download this overview as PDF file.\nIf you have any feedback or questions, you are more than welcome to send me an email to jonas at neubert dot eu"
