:::{#about-me}

Hello! I'm Jonas Neubert. My research interests are romantic relationships (particularly non-heteronormative ones) and serotonergic psychedelics. I have interviewed couples about their psychedelic experiences ([link to the pre-print](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pd6r9)) and hope to do more qualitative research in the future. I have recently completed my research internship at the [Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/neuropsychology-and-psychopharmacology) research department at Maastricht University and my master's thesis titled "Relationships and psychedelics: Does a shared LSD experience alter relationship quality and conflict behaviour?"

Get in touch via [email](mailto:jonas@neubert.eu).
